Glacier modelling of HBV for the glacier Hardangenjokulen
This project gives the scripts to run the HBV model for the Hardangenjokulen glacier. 
There are ** catchments, and ** of them have mass balance data. 
The general purpose is to make a simple way to use HBV for glacier simulation. 

The project includes all procedures to run the HBV model for this glacier. Therefore, this project can be used as a good example or a easy start if someone new wants to use this model.

There are many files to prepare. Be patient!
