Glacier modelling of HBV for the glacier Hardangenjokulen
This project gives the scripts to run the HBV model for the Hardangenjokulen glacier. The general purpose is to make a simple way to use HBV for glacier simulation.

There are 4 outlets and 3 of them have subcatchments. Only one of the subcatchments have mass balance data. There are quite many lakes and resevoirs, so one concern is flooding and hydropower potential.

The project includes all procedures to run the HBV model for this glacier. Therefore, this project can be used as a good example or a easy start if someone new wants to use this model.

The files are on NVE computer: R:\NorgeIsModelling

There are many files to prepare. Be patient!
